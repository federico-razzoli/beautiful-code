# beautiful-code

Code should be beautiful, when possible. Remember: developers spend a lot of time looking at code,
typing it, designing it. The aesthetics of code improve the quality of their life. It inspires them
to develop even better code, to discuss with others about code and logic, and to think about problems
and solutions more in depth.

In this repository I'm collecting code that seems to me beautiful.
